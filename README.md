# TRI MODE MAC to AXI BUFFER
## DESIGN NOTICE
As with most FPGA impelmented SV there could be protability issues. I do my best to include vendor specific defines but there may be cases where those get missed and LATTICE, ATMEL, ALTERA, and XILINX ISE may have synthesis issues. I include all RTL/SIM source that I have but typicaly will not include project files. This means that refrenced files must be included appropreatly.
## DESCRIPTION
AXI4 LITE buffer for the OpenCores Trimode Ethernet MAC. Include basic simulation.
An AXI4 LITE Buffer that will connect with the OpenCores Trimode Ethernet MAC.
